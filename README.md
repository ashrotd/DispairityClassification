Accurate cloud base height estimation holds paramount significance in applications such as aviation safety. Existing solutions, such as ceilometers, although effective, are cost-prohibitive and lack portability, limiting their utility for smaller airports, vertiports, and ad hoc operations. This paper introduces an innovative, cost-effective solution leveraging stereo camera setups combined with deep learning. Utilizing a virtual environment, we rendered a diverse set of volumetric clouds at varying altitudes. Stereo-matching techniques obtained disparity maps from the captured image pairs. Building upon this data, we trained a model to transform into precise cloud height predictions. Our approach marries the affordability of stereo cameras with the computational prowess of deep learning, offering a promising alternative to traditional cloud height estimation instruments. Instead of pursuing traditional 3D reconstruction methods in this study, we focused on training a CNN model, using the disparity map. Our model went through multi-class classification of a range of classes from 500 m to 3500 m based on cloud base height with high accuracy.
